title: New blog setup: nginx, Hakyll, rsync
description: Overview comparing my new blog setup to my old Wordpress one

<p>
I've decided to move to a static site so it remains snappy with a minimum of CPU expense. The site is now generated by Hakyll (and Compass/Sass for the CSS), and rsynced to my server running nginx.

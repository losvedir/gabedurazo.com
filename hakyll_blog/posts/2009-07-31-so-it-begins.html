title: So It Begins
description: Wherein I announce the commencement of blogging
---

<p>I’ve finally set up a blog at my site. Great. Now I’m one of those people.</p>

<p>Anyway, I don’t count on anyone reading it, so don’t you worry about that. I will use it more as a place to keep track of what I’ve done to get this site going, and random thoughts I have that I’ll want to remember for the future.<p>

<p>I suppose I can make predictions, too, and then point to them in the future (deleting all the ones that fail, of course…).</p>

<p>First order of business: Integrate this blog with my site. Time to delve into the WordPress php!</p>

<p>[Note: This post refers to my previous Wordpress blog]</p>

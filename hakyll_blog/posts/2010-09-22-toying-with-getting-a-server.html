title: Toying with Getting a Server
description: Some of the decisions to make when setting up a server
---

<p>As of late, my roommate and I have thought it would be fun to build and administer a server for our apartment. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t seem wise, for me, to spend money on a server at this point (I recently negotiated myself down from 60 hrs/wk to 30 at work in order to work on an iPhone app with a friend). However, my temporary self-justification is this: </p>
<p>I recently liquidated my position in palladium and am looking for my next investment. I have no idea what&#8217;s going to happen with the economy. I&#8217;m generally bearish, thinking we&#8217;ll have the Dow crash below 9000 before it hits 12,000 again. On the flip side,  I&#8217;m worried about inflation, so I don&#8217;t want to maintain a large cash position either. TIPS might be good, but the government debt is so huge, I&#8217;m somewhat worried about default. So I don&#8217;t know where to invest. About the only thing I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll always have a good ROI on is&#8230; me! So, why not spend the money on a server? I&#8217;ll blog about all my decisions and research, and I&#8217;ll learn a ton. Right? Right? Meh&#8230;</p>
<p>So, assuming I decide to move forward with this, I will get to research and decide on lots of interesting things, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Processor &#8211; Intel (i5? i7?) or AMD? What&#8217;s the difference? 32 or 64 bit? I think 64 because we&#8217;re going to stuff the thing with gobs of RAM.
<li>GPU &#8211; Do we want one? They&#8217;re really good for certain kinds of computation. If we could utilize it for Jason&#8217;s research, it would be pretty badass. I&#8217;ve heard a lot about this &#8220;CUDA&#8221; thing (or wait! OpenCL? Sigh&#8230;) &#8212; might be interesting to look into. (http://llpanorama.wordpress.com/cuda-tutorial/) Don&#8217;t really need it for computer game type things, though &#8212; servers aren&#8217;t really used for that. Maybe video re-encoding for the media server aspect.
<li>RAM &#8211; How much? My linode has like 20GB or something awesome like that, but it&#8217;s shared with several virtual hosts. We&#8217;ll probably want several gigs. What kind? I&#8217;m dimly aware of the fact that there&#8217;s DDR and other acronyms and different numbers after the acronym, but I have no idea what that all means.
<li> Motherboard &#8212; probably determined by everything else, I&#8217;d guess.
<li> Hard disk &#8211; here&#8217;s where we get especially awesome. Jason will want to store oodles of astronomical data, and I&#8217;ll want a media server with, again, oodles of data. Probably terabytes, lots of &#8216;em, and RAID so it&#8217;s fast and fault tolerant. What RAID, though? I guess I&#8217;ll be learning (again) what the different variants are.
<li> Misc &#8211; what else will I want? TV Tuner, wifi? Ethernet (will definitely want one, are there choices to be made?). Bluetooth for mouse keyboard? Or will this thing just be ssh&#8217;ed into from our respective laptops? Is there still other hardware I haven&#8217;t even thought to ask about yet??
<li>Software &#8212; have to decide what OS to run. That will probably to some extent determine what hardware I can get, for compatibility reasons. Probably some linux, but which? Gentoo, so we compile everything personally? I&#8217;ve had good luck with my Ubuntu 10.04 linode. Maybe some sort of Xen setup to virtualize several OSes?
</ul>
<p>Fun, fun, fun.</p>
<p>Lastly, what to do with the server? You may say this is the thing to determine first, and you&#8217;d be right. But I have no idea. I&#8217;m just operating under a &#8220;if you build it they will come&#8221; philosophy. I feel like if I have uber computing power under my command, I will think of interesting things to do with it. Probably at least a media server, although the server I want to build is probably overkill for that simple use. In addition, I *do* have my iPhone app that could utilize it, so there&#8217;s always that. I could save the $20/month I pay to linode, at any rate. And I suppose the negligbile amount of money I pay to nearlyfreespeech.net. Ah well, I&#8217;ll figure out something. It&#8217;ll be fun!</p>

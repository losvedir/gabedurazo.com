description: Recap of the 2010 Mystery Hunt

<p>Last weekend was <a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/">MIT&#8217;s annual mystery hunt</a>. There were a number of cool puzzles, as always, but I just wanted to highlight <a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/10/puzzles/2010/TUO_YRREJ_PEEK/">this &#8220;Be Kind Rewind&#8221;-esque one</a>. For this puzzle, we had to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweded#.22Sweded.22">&#8220;Swede&#8221;</a> a popular movie and upload the resulting 3-4 minute clip to Youtube to submit. We weren&#8217;t allowed to say any of the main words in the title. See if you can guess what movie we were assigned&#8230;</p>

<p>Evans and I did the video editing on that bad boy. iMovie is pretty impressive!</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m at it. Here&#8217;s another video my team had to make for the Hunt a few years ago. It&#8217;s the trailer for a hypothetical sequel to the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0492506/">Wordplay</a>. Greg Schroll did most of the editing on this one (hence it&#8217;s higher quality&#8230;), although I did suggest the music that plays, and the (spoiler) laser pointer idea.</p>

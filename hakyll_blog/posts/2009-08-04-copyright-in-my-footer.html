title: Copyright, in *my* footer?!
description: A cursory look at the issues surrounding copyrights
---

<p>[Note: This post applies to my previous Wordpress blog]</p>

<p>I struggled for a bit with what to put in the little black bar at the bottom of the page. I poked around at <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/">some websites</a> <a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/">that I like</a> <a href="http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/">the design of<a>. Two had the little copyright symbol, and one didn't.</p>

<p>I like the copyright at the bottom because it seems more "professional". But mindlessly mimicking professionalism is dumb. If I actually paid the $35 and <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/eco/">registered my site</a> with the Copyright Office, then I'd put that down there in a heartbeat. Still, I <a href="http://inventors.about.com/od/copyrights/a/CopyrightNotice.htm">don't seem to</a> <em>need</em> to do that in order to justify the symbol:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The use of the copyright notice is the responsibility of the copyright owner and does not require advance permission from, or registration with, the Copyright Office.
</p></blockquote>

<p>But, really, do I care if someone uses my design or words? No.</p>

<p>There are three things that I want down there:</p>

<ol>
<li>Notice that I was the one who designed and implemented the site.</li>
<li>What year it was "born" (might be cool in 20 years to show that gabedurazo.com has been around that long)</li>
<li>"Gabriel Durazo", to help search engines link this site with my name. "Gabe Durazo" (URL) and "Gabriel J Durazo" (In the header) both point here no problem, but not "Gabriel Durazo" yet.
</ol>

<p>But if I have those three things, I may as well toss in a &copy and be done with it.</p>

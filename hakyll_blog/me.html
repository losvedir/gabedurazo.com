	<h1>Brief Bio</h1>
	<p>
		I'm a Boston-based twenty six year old striving to envision the future so I can help make it happen. I have experience creating mobile apps, websites (front-end and back-end), and desktop programs, and am consequently familiar with a diverse set of software technologies.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I graduated from MIT in 2007 with a degree in Economics and 2008 with one in Math+CS.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		For 2.5 years after graduation I worked at Lazard Capital Markets, a finance firm, in equity research. I took and passed my <a href="http://www.finra.org/industry/compliance/registration/qualificationsexams/registeredreps/p011051">Series 7, 63, 86, and 87 tests</a>, licensing me in Massachusetts as a Research Analyst. I primarily reported to a brilliant woman named Ilonna Rimm, the youngest person ever to earn an MD PhD from Harvard. She took me under her wing and taught me tons of valuable life lessons like how to organize and prioritize tasks, how to excel in a business environment, and, notably, how to write succinctly. While it was an incredibly educational experience, I ultimately realized I was not feeling "fulfilled" and should not follow a career in finance.

		In April, 2011, I quit to join a small start-up, <a href="http://www.athleticstandard.com">Athletic Standard</a> as the "Jack-of-all-Tech". Athletic Standard tests the athletic performance of high school athletes in order to help college coaches and recruiters find players for their teams. I developed front-end and back-end website features, glued together Joomla (a PHP CMS) components, wrote a Java application to serve as our prototype touchscreen kiosk interface, and more. The act of making things that people use is immensely satisfying.
